DevOps = Development(plan, code, test, build) + Operations(release, deploy, monitor, operate)



-> Collaboration between development and operations teams

-> Automation of software delivery processes

-> continuous Integration (CI) and continuous Delivery (CD)

-> Improve quality and speed



-> continuous integration

&nbsp;	- Automatically build and test when there is change in code

&nbsp;	- Ensures the bug free code

&nbsp;	- Ensures higher code quality and reduces integration issues

&nbsp;	- Packeting the applications (war/jar/docker image)



-> Continuous deployment

&nbsp;	- Automatically deploy for production



**Life cycle:**

Code -> Build -> Test -> Deployment



**Tools:**

Code - Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

Build - war/Jar/Docker images

Test - Pytest, Junit test, SonarQube

Deploy - Apache/Tomcat, Docker, Kubernets



**Git:**

 - It is a version control repository
